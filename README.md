# Spotify Clone
This is based on basics of HTML and CSS. 
# Description
In this project, I have made the clone of Spotify's home page.
I have used many photos which I have added in my repo by creating a folder name 'spotifyassests'.
I have taken the font of the project from Google Fonts.
I have taken the basic icons used in my project from Font Awesome.
I have used my basic knowledge and learning of HTML and CSS to create the home page clone.
